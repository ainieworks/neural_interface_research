## Research Methodology – Neural Interfaces

• Define the problem: mapping EEG/brain signals to intelligent system outputs  
• Identify signal type, frequency ranges, noise issues  
• Select preprocessing pipeline (filtering → segmentation → feature extraction)  
• Compare feature extraction methods for brain signal patterns  
• Evaluate ML models suitable for translating signals to commands  
• Validate accuracy and latency in controlled tasks
